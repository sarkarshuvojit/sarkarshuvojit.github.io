Hey everyone, this "blog" is a product of boredom and free weekends.
I'll be posting every weekend about things related to `programming` and `software development` 
in-general.

I will also try to incorporate some other elements in this blog which 
 are uncommon with most tech-blogs.
 
So, here's a comprehensive list of the kinds of things I'm going to post about.

- Small tutorials about stuff
- Occasionally, if I come across an interesting bug while working, I will put up a
 nice report about it, what the issue was, how I figured it out, how much time was wasted on it, 
 how stupid I was to miss it, etc. categorised as `field reports`.
- Interviews with some coders from the Calcutta scene, mostly people I know personally. 
About how they started off with programming, and what their 
tips are on mastering whatever they specialise on.
